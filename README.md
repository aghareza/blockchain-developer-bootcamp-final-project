# Mint Tokens

## Overview

The goal of this project is to allow for registration of intent to mint a NFT project. This would be done by first purchasing a mint token then staking a mint token towards a project. Once the minting of a project begins, through some kind of pre-sale, users will be able to have their staked tokens consumed for a NFT. Users will be able to unstake at anytime and also redeem inital payment by returning their mint tokens. 


## Example Workflow

1. User buys any number of mint tokens.
2. User stakes tokens for project they want to mint.
3. When minting starts user mints project but stake tokens are consumed
